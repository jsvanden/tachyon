Made in a 4 weeks for CMPM 120: Game Development Experience by Prof. Arnav Jhala Spr 2016 Final Project. We had to do a Javascript game based upon a recent news story which for us was gravity waves and how they related to the general theory of relativity.

This game was created through a collaborative effort of the entire team who gained direction and knowledge from our TA Ben and our Professors Robin Hunike and Arnav Jhala. It is with their help that we were able to make a great a success.
